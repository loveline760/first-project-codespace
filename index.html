        <h1><b>EARLY LIFE OF NELSON MANDELA </b></h1>
                 <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on 18 July 1918 in Mvezo, Umtata (now Mthatha), Transkei, South Africa. 
                    He had thirteen siblings by the same father, and two mothers.
                    His parents were Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa and His given name was Rolihlahla, a Xhosa name meaning pulling the branch of a tree or informally, troublemaker. 
                    He was a member of the Thembu royal family.
                    On his first day of school, he was given the name Nelson by his teacher Miss Mdingane.
                    Giving children in Africa English names was a custom among Africans during that period.
                    Mandela's father died when he was twelve. Mandela then lived with the local regent who sent him to school. 
                    He was the first member of his family to go to a school. He was expelled from Fort Hare University in 1941, because he led a group of students on political strike.
                    After he was expelled, Nelson found a job as a night watchman.</p>
        <h2><b>ANTI- APARTHEID ACTIVITY</b></h2>
                <p>In 1944, Mandela helped start the African National Congress Youth League. He was soon a high-ranked leader of the group. 
                    He wanted to free South Africa without violence, but the government started killing and hurting protesters. 
                    He then started Umkhonto we Sizwe with Walter Sisulu and other people in the African National Congress that he admired, such as Mahatma Gandhi.
                    A trial was later held and became known as the Rivonia Trial. 

                    Mandela was on trial because of his involvement in sabotage and violence in 1962. 
                    He was sentenced to life in prison, and was sent to Robben Island, but was transferred to Victor Verster Prison in 1988. 
                    In 1990, he was let out of Victor Verster Prison after 26.5 years. He left prison after de Klerk removed a ban on the African National Congress. 
                    He ordered Mandela's release. He then received the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993, with former State President of South Africa, Frederik Willem de Klerk.</p>

        <h3><b>PRESIDENCY</b></h3>
                 <P>Mandela won the general election in April 1994. His inauguration was in Pretoria on 10 May 1994. 
                    Many people around the world saw his inauguration on television. 
                    The event had 4000 guests, including world leaders from different backgrounds. 
                    Mandela was the first South African President elected in a completely democratic election.
                    As South Africa's first black President, Mandela became head of the Government of National Unity which was under controlled by the African National Congress (or ANC). 
                    The ANC had no knowledge in politics, but had representatives from the National Party and Inkatha. 
                    In keeping with earlier promises, de Klerk became first Deputy President, while Thabo Mbeki was chosen second.</P>
